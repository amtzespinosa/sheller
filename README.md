# Sheller

**[Sheller](https://amtzespinosa.github.io/projects/sheller/)** is a simple Online Reverse Shell Generator built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. It's already up and running in my website, check it **[here](https://amtzespinosa.github.io/projects/sheller/)**!

I have based this project on the amazing [RevShells](https://www.revshells.com/) that supports way more languages and variants of all type of shells. I just wanted this project to be as simple as possible although Iâ€™m thinking of adding more features.

By now: 

- You can only generate **Netcat** and **MetaSploit** listeners
- It only supports **python, perl, bash** and **php** reverse shells
- I added a little cheatsheet to make your shell interactive
- And you can change the theme. This feature is a bit dodgy but, who cares?

I just made this little project as a basic refresher of the languages used as well as DOM JavaScript. Hope it helps someone!
