# sheller
Sheller is a simple Online Reverse Shell Generator built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have based this project on the amazing RevShells that supports way more languages and variants of all type of shells. I just wanted this project to be as simple as possible although Iâ€™m thinking of adding more features.
